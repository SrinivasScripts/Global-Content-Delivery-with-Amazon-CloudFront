## Introduction

A static website hosted on Amazon S3 requires efficient global content delivery. This project aims to address this challenge by utilizing Amazon CloudFront along with regional failover, AWS Lambda@Edge for dynamic content, optimized caching behaviors, and secure HTTPS delivery.

## Features

- Low-latency access with Amazon CloudFront.
- Regional failover and static content delivery with Amazon S3.
- Dynamic content generation using AWS Lambda@Edge.
- Optimized caching behaviors for enhanced performance.
- Secure content delivery through HTTPS.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and configure the global content delivery system:

### 1. Implement Amazon CloudFront

- Create a new CloudFront distribution.
- Configure the origin domain name to point to the S3 bucket.
- Adjust caching behaviors for optimal performance.

### 2. Set Up Regional Failover and Static Content

- Create a second S3 bucket in a different AWS region.
- Configure CloudFront to use both primary and backup S3 buckets.
- Adjust distribution settings for failover.

### 3. Use AWS Lambda@Edge for Dynamic Content

- Write Lambda functions for dynamic content generation.
- Deploy Lambda functions to AWS Lambda.
- Associate Lambda functions with CloudFront behaviors.

### 4. Configure Caching Behaviors and Distribution Settings

- Adjust cache TTLs, enable query string parameters, etc.
- Define cache behaviors for different content types.
- Fine-tune distribution settings.

### 5. Implement HTTPS for Secure Content Delivery

- Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager.
- Configure CloudFront to use the certificate for HTTPS.
- Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
